Hacking my neovim setup for ultimate IDE features yet minimal interface

## Missing features(small)

- ~Better file manager than Vifm -- which shows hierarchy, opens at the current file (not root)~
- ~Collapasble side-bar with git information about staged and unstaged files, with easy diff viewer~

## Missing features(large)

- ~Ability to resolve merge conflicts in a three-way panes layout~
- PR review helpers -- Ability to see the changes files in a range, and open their diff
- Abiltiy to define scopes - included-excluded directories, allowed/masked file patterns (some project based config approach)
- Ability to use case-sensitive,word-matches, and regex for search (hack with fzf)
- Ability to use scopes for search (hack with fzf)
- Ability to use scopes for references, usages and implementations (hack with coc)
